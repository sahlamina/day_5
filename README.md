#Academy day 5 notes
Network diagram is used for the planning process 

Full macro view of the project including micro characteristics such as cost/time 
When environmental factors change it is necessary to adapt, and allow for contingencies so that external or internal factors that have not been registered can be taken into account 

Network diagram – flow from left to right 
1.	Task breakdown 
2.	Estimation – time and cost are calculated (predictions) this is the stage were contingencies are implemented 
3.	Logical dependencies – the logical order of a project, decomposing a large project into small dependencies that follow a logical order and when placed together create the final/whole product 
Precedence table – predecessor relationship between tasks – once you work out the start node you can begin to create a predecessor table where tasks are defined by their perquisite tasks 
4.	Network diagram – precedence table is then translated into a network diagram. 

The network diagram allows us to see the logical order of activities and to define our critical path 


Activity on Node (AoN) – help you estimate time 

Earliest start / Latest start 
Duration/ Float 

Float = latest start – early start – the amount of time the tasks are able to slip within that project 

Early start + duration = early start of the next node 

Take the maximum early start if there are two nodes on the same level 

Latest start of the present node – duration of predecessor duration = latest start of predecessor node 

Critical path is the longest path which has 0 float 

Critical path is the longest path through the network – gives you a logical estimate on a project
-	The maximum duration of a project
-	Latest start of current node – latest start of predecessor =  latest start

Tech talk
-	SAM steal and modify
-	Skills for the information age SFIA +
o	Skills need ed for IT departments

Attitudes of mature teams
-	Co-located 
o	So people in different parts of the world and making things like time difference work
-	Cross functional i.e. DevOps
-	Self organising
-	Accountable and empowered
o	Your teams success is your success vice a versa
-	Test and learn feedback loops
o	Improving through iterations
-	QA – quality assurance
-	BA – business analyst
-	PM – Prpject Management
-	UX – User experience
-	Dev – Development
Projects are difficult
-	Create a positive environment
-	Manage conflict intelligently
-	Have open and clear communication
-	Respect all of your peers
-	Become trustworthy
Business Cases 

Return on investment
-	Idea that project should be profitable
-	There are instances in which ROI cannot be achieved as a result of things out of control
Why is it so important to identify ROI
-	It comes down to the worth of he product to the people who need it
Cashflow exercises 
Risk
-	Things that pose a threat to the success of the project
Why is it so important to identify risk early in any project
-	To make the project as infallible as possible
Some sources of risk
-	Technology, Team, Scope, Business, Economy, Competition 
-	SWOT strength weaknesses opportunities and threats
Dealing with risk
-	Avoidance
-	Transfer 
-	Reduce
-	Accept
-	Exploit
-	Share – using AWS’s security to mitigate 
-	Enhance
-	Ignore
Stakeholders 
-	People who are impacted by  the progress and success of the project
-	Power/ interest grid
Stakeholder Attitudes
-	Champion
o	They will be an aid to the success of the proj
-	Supporter
o	People who speak of the proj in a positive light
-	Neutral
o	People who are neither for nor against the success of the project
-	Critic
-	Opponent
o	Competition like rival companies
-	Blocker
o	Anybody actively blocking project progress are considered blockers
Planning
-	Planning involves setting out the roadmap for the project by creating the following plans
o	Proj plan
o	Resource plan
o	Financial plan
o	Quality plan
o	Acceptance plan
o	Communication plan
